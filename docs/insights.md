# Insights & Conclusions

Automated analytics, correlations, conflict checks, and downloadable reports.

## Data requirements

- `priority`, `requested_hours`, `total_visibility_hours`, `scheduled_flag`
- Visibility windows (parsed) and derived fields improve insights but are not strictly required for all sections.

## What you see

- Key Metrics
  - Scheduling Rate (with counts)
  - Mean Priority (with median)
  - Total Visibility (hours)
- Priority Analysis
  - Comparison of mean priority for scheduled vs unscheduled
- Automated Insights
  - Bullet list generated from dataset metrics
- Correlation Analysis
  - Spearman correlations across key variables
  - Heatmap (Plotly)
  - Interpretation panel with guidance on |œÅ| thresholds
- Top Observations
  - Tabs: Top 10 by Priority, Top 10 by Total Visibility Hours
- Scheduling Integrity
  - Conflicts table (outside visibility, before/after fixed constraints)
  - Conflict types documented on the page
- Downloadable Report
  - Markdown and HTML reports (all metrics/insights/correlations/conflicts)

## Notes

- Correlations and insights are computed by `tsi.services.analytics` and visualized via `tsi.plots.distributions.build_correlation_heatmap`.
- Reports are generated by `tsi.services.report` as fully self-contained text/HTML artifacts.
